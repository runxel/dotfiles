# VSCode Settings

I have "Settings Sync" turned on, so most of the settings are gonna move from one place to another.  
However the keyboard shortcuts won't come along if your other system differs, i.e. Windows ‚Üî Mac, which kind of defeats the purpose of this very system... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That's why I have them here seperately again.


On Windows these settings live in `C:\Users\Lucas\AppData\Roaming\Code\User`.
