# Roccat Mouse configuration on MacOS

Since there are no drivers from Roccat for MacOS you'll need a copy of Windows lying around, with the driver installed.
There I'd recommend to make another profile, at least if you need to switch systems with the mouse.
Luckily all the configuration lives on the mouse itself, so once you have set what you want it will just work out of the box.
Remember: 
- WIN key == ⌘ Command
- Ctrl  == ⌃ Control
- Alt  ==  ⌥ Option
- Shift ... obviously is still ⇧ Shift
